# random-linux-projects
Just an assortment of random lines of code that I need to be accessible whenever I bork up my linux system, again.

## Software I used:
1. Openssh (obviously)
2. Cockpit/Casaos (I would not reccommend casa and instead would say to use TrueNAS)
3. Samba
4. Docker
5. Tailscale
6. Ngrok (before tailscale and as a systemd service)
7. Git
8. Zip
9. jq 
10. acpi (I have a laptop)

## And I used two containers for the tmodloader server:
a. [hardwarehaven/ngrok2discord](https://hub.docker.com/r/hardwarehaven/ngrok2discord#!)
b. [jacobsmile/tmodloader1.4](https://hub.docker.com/r/jacobsmile/tmodloader1.4)
