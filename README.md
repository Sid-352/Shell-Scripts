# Shell-scripts
Just an assortment of lines of shell code that I need to be accessible whenever I bork up my linux system, again.

### Some software that generally I use:
1. Openssh
2. Cockpit/Casaos (I would not reccommend casa and instead would recommend TrueNAS)
3. Samba
4. Docker
5. Tailscale
6. Ngrok
7. Git
8. Zip
9. Jq 
10. Acpi 
11. Yatch
