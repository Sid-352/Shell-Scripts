# random-linux-projects
Just an assortment of random lines of code that I need to be accessible whenever I bork up my linux system, again.

## Software I used:
1. openssh (obviously)
2. cockpit/casaos (I would not reccommend casa and instead would say to use TrueNAS)
3. samba
4. docker
5. tailscale
6. ngrok (before tailscale and as a systemd service)
7. git
8. zip
9. jq 
10. acpi (I have a laptop)
11. yatch (with cockpit, you can try it tho)

## And I used two containers for the tmodloader server:
a. [hardwarehaven/ngrok2discord](https://hub.docker.com/r/hardwarehaven/ngrok2discord#!)

b. [jacobsmile/tmodloader1.4](https://hub.docker.com/r/jacobsmile/tmodloader1.4)
