## Systemd-ngrok

Actually quite easy to setup thanks again to hardwarehaven. Clone [this](https://github.com/vincenthsu/systemd-ngrok) github repository and make the needed changes to the ngrok.yml file (I gave an example file here). After that you just need to run the installer using: 
```bash
sudo ./install.sh <authtoken_here>
```
